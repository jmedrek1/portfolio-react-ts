I've lived in New England all my life. Born in Massachusetts, raised in Connecticut. Living here provided me with the opportunity to go to CREC's Academy of Aerospace and Engineering, a magnet high school in greater Hartford. At my high school, I was able to pursue my favorite school subject and my current college major.

Right now I'm a rising senior at the University of Connecticut, studying computer science. I'm also a software engineering intern at The Hartford. When I graduate in 2025, I plan to become a software engineer.
