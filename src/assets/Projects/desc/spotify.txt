This full-stack clone of the Spotify platform was, without a doubt, the most involved personal project I've worked on. While it might not be creative in the fact that I'm trying to emulate a site that already exists, I think the clone does a pretty good job.

It's built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Supabase. This was my first time using React or any of its frameworks before, and there was definitely a learning curve. Starting the process of learning React made me appreciate Vue and its relative simplicity that much more!
