This was my starter project as a new developer for UConn's Digital Experience Group. Super basic idea, but pretty well executed with positive feedback. The UConn Rudd Center reached out to DXG and asked us to create a "health index" calculator related to WellSCAN (another DXG project) based on the proportion of healthy, medium and unhealthy foods entered in.

The building of this CFNI calculator helped me expand my knowledge of JavaScript along with Git and source control. Being able to initiate a pull request and to push to a new branch is useful for me to know going into the software industry.

The final product was delivered to UConn's Rudd Center as an embedded page.
