This is a project hosted through Firebase that shows all of UConn's outgoing grants from the past two years. Each of Connecticut's towns is represented with a dot sized according to how much money was given to that particular town. The data for this came from a massive Excel spreadsheet, which alone took forever to comb through.

Working on Grant Trails was my first exposure to Vue.js, Vuex, Supabase and SQL. Safe to say it was the biggest and most challenging project I've done so far. This wasn't a solo project, so it provided me the chance to work on my communication and code review skills.
