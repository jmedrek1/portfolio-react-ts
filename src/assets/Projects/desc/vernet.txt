VeRNet was the first project I got to assist with during my position at UConn's Cyber-Physical Systems Lab as an undergrad researcher. The tech stack for this site uses Vue.js, TypeScript, Apache ECharts and Element Plus. These help to create a responsive site with multiple components, and along with Three.js, provides a way to emulate a computer network in 3D.

The site displays a topology of around 20 nodes, with a central node sending out packets to the others. This is all simulated smoothly, and provides a way to visualize how signals in a network travel. VeRNet was originally created by Jiachen Wang, a recent Ph.D. recipient who is also a member of the CPS Lab.
